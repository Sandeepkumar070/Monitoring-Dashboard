a)Date, time, and location of the incident
b)Type of incident (Major Incident, Minor Incident, First Aid, Other)
c)Personnel involved and injury details
d)Description of the event
e)Root cause and corrective/preventive actions taken

2. 𝙎𝙖𝙛𝙚𝙩𝙮 𝙄𝙣𝙘𝙞𝙙𝙚𝙣𝙩 𝙍𝙚𝙥𝙤𝙧𝙩 𝘿𝙚𝙨𝙘𝙧𝙞𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣
a)The system provides tabular and graphical reports of safety incidents, enabling supervisors and safety officers to View incidents over a selected time period
b)Filter by type, location, severity, or department
c)Analyze trends to support decision-making and risk prevention
d)Monitor status of action taken (Open, In Progress, Closed)

3. 𝙆𝙚𝙮 𝙁𝙪𝙣𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙖𝙡𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙚𝙨 
a)Add Incident: Submit new safety incidents via a structured digital form.
b)Edit Incident: Update details, investigation, or status of existing records.
c)Search/Filter: Find incidents by date, type, location, or personnel.
d)Export Reports: Download reports in Excel, CSV, or PDF for audits and sharing.

The Quality Module tracks and manages product and process quality across the plant. It allows users to log defects, perform root cause analysis, implement corrective actions, and monitor quality trends through reports and charts. Helps ensure continuous improvement and compliance.
𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲
Tracks production-related costs including material, labor, and overhead. Helps analyze cost per product/unit and supports cost-saving decisions.
𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲
Monitors employee attendance, shift allocation, performance, and safety training. Enhances workforce management and operational efficiency.
𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲 
Manages monthly, weekly, and daily production targets. Compares plan vs. actual output to improve scheduling, resource allocation, and productivity.


𝗟𝗼𝘀𝘀 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 
The Loss Analysis module identifies and categorizes factors that cause production downtime, reduced output, and inefficiencies. It helps analyze root causes, measure loss impact in terms of time and quantity, and supports continuous improvement through data-driven decision-making.
𝗦𝗶𝘅 𝗕𝗶𝗴 𝗟𝗼𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀
This analysis focuses on the six major categories of production loss as defined in TPM (Total Productive Maintenance):
1)Equipment Failure (Breakdowns)
2)Setup and Adjustment Time
3)Idling and Minor Stops
4)Reduced Speed
5)Process Defects
6)Reduced Yield (Start-up Losses)
By tracking and analyzing these losses, the system helps improve OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) and optimize production efficiency.
